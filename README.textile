h2(#intro). Introduction

RMagick is an interface between the Ruby programming language and the
ImageMagick image processing library.

h2(#prereq). Prerequisites

These prerequisites are required for the latest DEVELOPMENT version of RMagick. To see prerequisites for the latest RELEASED version of the gem, switch to the master branch.

*O/S* Linux, &#042;BSD, OS X, Windows 2000, XP, Vista, other &#042;nix-like systems.

*Ruby* 2.3 or later. You can get Ruby from "www.ruby-lang.org":http://www.ruby-lang.org.

Ruby must be able to build C-Extensions (e.g. MRI, Rubinius, not JRuby)

*ImageMagick* Version 6.7.7 or later (6.x.x). Version 7 is NOT yet supported; ETA Summer 2019 (https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/issues/256). You can get ImageMagick from "www.imagemagick.org":http://www.imagemagick.org.

On Ubuntu, you can run:

bc. sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev

On Centos, you can run:

bc. sudo yum install gcc ImageMagick-devel make which

*Note to Windows users:* Please make sure that you choose an ImageMagick version that matches the bitness of your Ruby version.

h2(#install). Installing RMagick

h4. Installing via Bundler

Add to your `Gemfile`:

bc. gem 'rmagick'

Then run:

bc. bundle install

h4. Installing via RubyGems

Run:

bc. gem install rmagick

h4. Versioning

RMagick is versioned according to Semantic Versioning.
For stable version compatible with Ruby 1.8+, use `~> 2.0`.
Upcoming version 3 will work on Ruby 2.x only.

h2(#usage). Using RMagick

Require RMagick in your project as follows:

bc. require 'rmagick'

See https://rmagick.github.io/usage.html for links to more information.

h2(#wrong). Things that can go wrong

The "RMagick installation FAQ":https://web.archive.org/web/20140512193354/http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-faq.html
has answers to the most commonly reported problems, though may be out of date.

h4. Can't install RMagick. Can't find libMagick or one of the dependent libraries. Check the mkmf.log file for more detailed information.

Typically this message means that one or more of the libraries that ImageMagick
depends on hasn't been installed. Examine the mkmf.log file in the ext/RMagick
subdirectory of the installation directory for any error messages. These messages
typically contain enough additional information for you to be able to diagnose
the problem. Also see "this FAQ":https://web.archive.org/web/20140512193354/http://rmagick.rubyforge.org/install-faq.html#libmagick.

On OS X with Homebrew, try [re]installing pkg-config:

<pre>
brew uninstall pkg-config
brew install pkg-config
brew unlink pkg-config
brew link pkg-config
</pre>

h4. Cannot open shared object file

If you get a message like this:

<pre>
    $DIR/RMagick.rb:11:in `require': libMagick.so.0:
      cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory -
      $DIR/RMagick2.so (LoadError)
</pre>

you probably do not have the directory in which the ImageMagick library
is installed in your load path.  An easy way to fix this is to define
the directory in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  For
example, suppose you installed the ImageMagick library libMagick.so in
/usr/local/lib.  (By default this is where it is installed.) Create the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable like this:

<pre>
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
</pre>

On Linux, see @ld(1)@ and @ld.so(8)@ for more information. On other operating
systems, see the documentation for the dynamic loading facility.

h4. Segmentation fault

Default stack size of your operating system might be too small. Try removing the limit with this command:

<pre>
        ulimit -s unlimited
</pre>

h2(#upgrade). Upgrading

If you upgrade to a newer release of ImageMagick, make sure you're using a
release of RMagick that supports that release. It's safe to install a new
release of RMagick over an earlier release.

h2(#samples). More samples

You can find more sample RMagick programs in the /example directory.
These programs are not installed in the RMagick documentation tree.

h2(#bugs). Reporting bugs

Please report bugs in RMagick, its documentation, or its installation
programs to me via the bug tracker on the "RMagick issues page":https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick/issues

However, I can't help with Ruby installation and configuration or ImageMagick
installation and configuration. Information about reporting problems and
getting help for ImageMagick is available at the "ImageMagick web site":http://www.imagemagick.org
or the "ImageMagick Forum":http://www.imagemagick.org/discourse-server.

h2(#dev-setup). Development Setup

In order to minimize issues on your local machine, we recommend that you make
use of a "Vagrant installation":https://github.com/tjschuck/rake-compiler-dev-box.

Steps to get up and running with a passing build are as follows:

h4. 1) set up the Vagrant environment

If you don't already have Vagrant installed, you can download and install it
from "here":https://www.vagrantup.com/. Once installed, we can set up a pre-built environment:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/tjschuck/rake-compiler-dev-box.git
cd rake-compiler-dev-box
vagrant up
</pre>

This last part will probably take a while as it has to download an Ubuntu image
and configure it. If there is an error during this process, you may need to
reboot your computer and enable virtualization in your BIOS settings.

h4. 2) clone RMagick and log in to the vagrant box

Within the `rake-compiler-dev-box` directory:

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/rmagick/rmagick.git # or your fork
vagrant ssh
</pre>

h4. 3) install ImageMagick and additional environment stuff

<pre>
cd /vagrant/rmagick
export IMAGEMAGICK_VERSION=6.8.9-10
sh ./before_install_linux.sh
</pre>

This will take just a few minutes to build ImageMagick

h4. 4) build RMagick

<pre>
rake
</pre>

This compiles the RMagick extensions and runs the tests. If all goes well
you'll see a lot of output, eventually ending in something like:

<pre>
Finished tests in 35.865734s, 11.3758 tests/s, 6560.3007 assertions/s.

408 tests, 235290 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
</pre>

And you're all set! The copy of RMagick within `/vagrant/rmagick` inside your
Vagrant session is the same as the one in the `rake-compiler-dev-box` directory
on your machine. You can make changes locally and run tests within your `ssh`
session.
